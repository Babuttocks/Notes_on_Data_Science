Types of Join\nThere are 4 main types of Join\n* Inner Join: returns rows when there is a match in both tables\n* Left Join: returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table. The rows for which there is no matching row on right side, the result-set will contain null. \n* Right Join − returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table. The rows for which there is no matching row on left side, the result-set will contain null.\n* Full Join − returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. The result-set will contain all the rows from both the tables. The rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values\n\nOther joins are:\n* Self Join − is used to join each row of a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement. In other words we can say that it is a join between two copies of the same table.\n* Cartesian Join / Cross Join− is also known as CROSS JOIN, it returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables. This usually happens when the matching column or WHERE condition is not specified.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Sytax\n# Inner Join\nSELECT column_name(s)\nFROM table1\nINNER JOIN

What is Normalization**\n\nNormalization is a way of organizing the data in the database. It is the processes of reducing the redundancy of data in the table and also improving the data integrity. Normalization entails organizing the columns and tables of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is the technique in which Non-redundancy and consistency data are stored in the set schema. By using normalization the number of tables is increased instead of decreased.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Q12.

Note that denormalization does not mean not doing normalization. It is an optimization technique that is applied after doing normalization.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### **Q13a. What are all the different normalizations**\n\n* 1st Normal Form (1NF)\n* 2nd Normal Form (2NF)\n* 3rd Normal Form (3NF)\n* Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)\n* 4NF (Fourth Normal Form) Rules\n* 5NF (Fifth Normal Form) Rules\n* 6NF (Sixth Normal Form) Proposed\n\n\n### **Q13b. The normal forms can be divided into 5 forms.**\n\n* 1. **1st Normal Form (1NF)**\nIn this Normal Form, we tackle the problem of atomicity. Here atomicity means values in the table should not be further divided. In simple terms, a single cell cannot hold multiple values. If a table contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the First Normal Form. Hence, it must be seperated.\n* * Each table cell should contain a single value.\n* * Each record needs to be unique.\n* 2. **2nd Normal Form (2NF)**\nThe first condition in the 2nd NF is that the table has to be in 1st NF. The table also should not contain partial dependency. Here partial dependency means the proper subset of candidate key determines a non-prime attribute.\n* * Rule 1- Be in 1NF\n* * Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation\n* 3. **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**\nThe same rule applies as before i.e, the table has to be in 2NF before proceeding to 3NF. The other condition is there should be no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes. That means non-prime attributes (which doesn’t form a candidate key) should not be dependent on other non-prime attributes in a given table. \n* * Rule 1- Be in 2NF\n* * Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies\n* 4. **Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**\nThis is also known as 3.5 NF. Its the higher version 3NF and was developed by Raymond F. Boyce and Edgar F. Codd to address certain types of anomalies which were not dealt with 3NF. \nBefore proceeding to BCNF, the table has to satisfy 3rd Normal Form.\n* 5. **4NF (Fourth Normal Form) Rules**\nIf no database table instance contains two or more, independent and multivalued data describing the relevant entity, then it is in 4th Normal Form.\n* 6. **5NF (Fifth Normal Form) Rules**\nA table is in 5th Normal Form only if it is in 4NF and it cannot be decomposed into any number of smaller tables without loss of data.\n* 7. **6NF (Sixth Normal Form) Proposed**\n6th Normal Form is not standardized, yet however, it is being discussed by database experts for some time.

What is a View?**\n\nIn SQL, **a view** is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. A view is created with the *Create View* Statement. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Q15. What is an Index?**\nIndexing is a data structure technique that helps to quickly retrieve data from a database file. Indexes are related to specific tables and consist of one or more keys.  A table can have more than one index built from it. The keys are based on the tables’ columns. \n\nAn index helps to speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses, but it slows down data input, with the UPDATE and the INSERT statements. Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data. Creating an index involves the CREATE INDEX statement, which allows you to name the index, to specify the table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate whether the index is in an ascending or descending order.\n\nThe indexing has various attributes:\n* Access Types: This refers to the type of access such as value based search, range access, etc.\n* Access Time: It refers to the time needed to find particular data element or set of elements.\n* Insertion Time: It refers to the time taken to find the appropriate space and insert a new data.\n* Deletion Time: Time taken to find an item and delete it as well as update the index structure.\n* Space Overhead: It refers to the additional space required by the index.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Q16a. Types of Index**\n\n* **Unique Indexes:** are used not only for performance, but also for data integrity. A unique index does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table. \n* **Composite Indexes:** this is an index on two or more columns of a table. Its basic syntax is as follows.\n* **Implicit Indexes:** these are indexes that are automatically created by the database server when an object is created. Indexes are automatically created for primary key constraints and unique constraints.\n* **Bitmap index:** this is a special kind of indexing that stores the bulk of its data as bit arrays (bitmaps) and answers most queries by performing bitwise logical operations on these bitmaps.\n* **Hash File organization:** Indices are based on the values being distributed uniformly across a range of buckets. The buckets to which a value is assigned is determined by a function called a hash function.\n* **Dense index:** this is a file with pairs of keys and pointers for every record in the data file. Every key in this file is associated with a particular pointer to a record in the sorted data file. In clustered indices with duplicate keys, the dense index points to the first record with that key.\n* **Sparse index:** this is a file with pairs of keys and pointers for every block in the data file. Every key in this file is associated with a particular pointer to the block in the sorted data file. In clustered indices with duplicate keys, the sparse index points to the lowest search key in each block.\n* **Reverse index:** this reverses the key value before entering it in the index. E.g., the value 24538 becomes 83542 in the index. Reversing the key value is particularly useful for indexing data such as sequence numbers, where new key values monotonically increase.\n* **Primary index:** this contains the key fields of the table and a pointer to the non-key fields of the table. The primary index is created automatically when the table is created in the database. As primary keys are unique and are stored in a sorted manner, the performance of the searching operation is quite efficient.\n* **Secondary index:** this is used to index fields that are neither ordering fields nor key fields. One index entry for every tuple in the data file (dense index) contains the value of the indexed attribute and pointer to the block or record.\n* **Sequential File Organization or Ordered Index File:** In this, the indices are based on a sorted ordering of the values. These are generally fast and a more traditional type of storing mechanism. These Ordered or Sequential file organization might store the data in a dense or sparse format.\n\n### **Q16b. Methods of Index**\n* **Clustered Indexing:**\nClustering alters the data block into a certain distinct order to match the index, resulting in the row data being stored in order. Therefore, only one clustered index can be created on a given database table. Clustered indices can greatly increase overall speed of retrieval, but usually only where the data is accessed sequentially in the same or reverse order of the clustered index, or when a range of items is selected.\nSince the physical records are in this sort order on disk, the next row item in the sequence is immediately before or after the last one, and so fewer data block reads are required. The primary feature of a clustered index is therefore the ordering of the physical data rows in accordance with the index blocks that point to them. Some databases separate the data and index blocks into separate files, others put two completely different data blocks within the same physical file.\nFor example, students studying in each semester are grouped together. i.e. 1st Semester students, 2nd semester students, 3rd semester students etc are grouped.\n\n* **Non-clustered or Secondary Indexing:**\nA non clustered index just tells us where the data lies, i.e. it gives us a list of virtual pointers or references to the location where the data is actually stored. Data is not physically stored in the order of the index. Instead, data is present in leaf nodes. E.g. the contents page of a book. Each entry gives us the page number or location of the information stored. The actual data here(information on each page of the book) is not organized but we have an ordered reference(contents page) to where the data points actually lie. We can have only dense ordering in the non-clustered index as sparse ordering is not possible because data is not physically organized accordingly.\nIt requires more time as compared to the clustered index because some amount of extra work is done in order to extract the data by further following the pointer. In the case of a clustered index, data is directly present in front of the index.\nIn a non-clustered index,\nThe physical order of the rows is not the same as the index order.\nThe indexed columns are typically non-primary key columns used in JOIN, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses.\nThere can be more than one non-clustered index on a database table.\n\n* **Multilevel or Cluster Indexing:**\nWith the growth of the size of the database, indices also grow. When multiple databases and multiple tables are joined, it is called a cluster. As the index is stored in the main memory, a single-level index might become too large a size to store with multiple disk accesses. The records for the tables sharing the value of a cluster key shall be stored together in the same or nearby data blocks. This may improve the joins of these tables on the cluster key, since the matching records are stored together. The multilevel indexing segregates the main block into various smaller blocks so that the same can stored in a single block. The outer blocks are divided into inner blocks which in turn are pointed to the data blocks. This can be easily stored in the main memory with fewer overheads.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Q17. What is a Cursor?**\nA cursor in SQL is a temporary work area created in system memory when a SQL statement is executed.

It is useful when we want to manipulate the record of a table in a singleton method, in other words, one row at a time. In other words, a cursor can hold more than one row but can process only one row at a time. The set of rows the cursor holds is called the active set.\n\nThere are two types of cursors:\n* Implicit Cursors: they are also known as Default Cursors of SQL SERVER.

What is a relationship and what are they?**\n\nIn a relational database, a relationship is formed by correlating rows belonging to different tables. A table relationship is established when a child table defines a Foreign Key column that references the Primary Key column of its parent table.\nEvery database table relationship is, therefore, built on top of Foreign Key columns, A relational database collects different types of data sets that use tables, records, and columns. It is used to create a well-defined relationship between database tables so that relational databases can be easily stored. \n\nThere are some important parameters of the relational database:\n* It is based on a relational model (Data in tables).\n* Each row in the table with a unique id, key.\n* Columns of the table hold attributes of data.\n\nThere can be three table relationship types:\n* **one-to-many** is the most common relationship, and it associates a row from a parent table to multiple rows in a child table. It is used to create a relationship between two tables. Any single rows of the first table can be related to one or more rows of the second tables, but the rows of second tables can only relate to the only row in the first table. \n* **one-to-one** requires the child table Primary Key to be associated via a Foreign Key with the parent table Primary Key column. It is basically used to create a relationship between two tables in which a single row of the first table can only be related to one and only one records of a second table. Similarly, the row of a second table can also be related to anyone row of the first table.\n* **many-to-many** requires a link table containing two Foreign Key columns that reference the two different parent tables. It create a relationship between two tables. Each record of the first table can relate to any records (or no records) in the second table.

If WHERE clause is used with DELETE command then it remove or delete only those rows(tuple) that satisfy the condition otherwise by default it removes all the tuples(rows) from the table. \n\n2. **TRUNCATE** is a DDL(Data Definition Language) command and is used to delete all the rows or tuples from a table. Unlike the DELETE command, TRUNCATE command does not contain a WHERE clause. In the TRUNCATE command, the transaction log for each deleted data page is recorded. Unlike the DELETE command, the TRUNCATE command is fast. Like DELETE, we can rollback the data even after using the TRUNCATE command. \n\n* **Difference between Delete and Truncate**\n1.

Clustered Index : \nA clustered index defines the order in which data is physically stored in a table. Table data can be sorted in only way, therefore, there can be only one clustered index per table. In SQL Server, the primary key constraint automatically creates a clustered index on that particular column.\n\nWhenever you apply clustered indexing in a table, it will perform sorting in that table only. You can create only one clustered index in a table like primary key. Clustered index is as same as dictionary where the data is arranged by alphabetical order. In clustered index, index contains pointer to block but not direct data. \n\n2. Non-clustered Index : \nA non-clustered index doesn’t sort the physical data inside the table. In fact, a non-clustered index is stored at one place and table data is stored in another place. This is similar to a textbook where the book content is located in one place and the index is located in another. This allows for more than one non-clustered index per table.\n\n##### Difference between CLUSTERED INDEX and NON-CLUSTERED INDEX\n* Clustered index is faster. Non-clustered index is slower.\n* Clustered index requires less memory for operations. Non-Clustered index requires more memory for operations.\n* In clustered index, index is the main data. In Non-Clustered index, index is the copy of data.\n* A table can have only one clustered index. A table can have multiple non-clustered index.\n* Clustered index has inherent ability of storing data on the disk. Non-Clustered index does not have inherent ability of storing data on the disk.\n* Clustered index store pointers to block not data. Non-Clustered index store both value and a pointer to actual row that holds data.\n* In Clustered index leaf nodes are actual data itself. In Non-Clustered index leaf nodes are not the actual data itself rather they only contains included columns.\n* In Clustered index, Clustered key defines order of data within table. In Non-Clustered index, index key defines order of data within index.\n* A Clustered index is a type of index in which table records are physically reordered to match the index. A Non-Clustered index is a special type of index in which logical order of index does not match physical stored order of the rows on disk.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# clustered Syntax\n# If you apply primary key to any column, then automatically it will become clustered index\ncreate table Student\n( Roll_No int primary key, \nName varchar(50), \nGender varchar(30), \nMob_No bigint );\n\ninsert into Student\nvalues (4, 'ankita', 'female', 9876543210 );\n\ninsert into Student \nvalues (3, 'anita', 'female', 9675432890 );\n\ninsert into Student \nvalues (5, 'mahima', 'female', 8976453201 ); \n\n#In this example, Roll no is a primary key, it will automatically act as a clustered index.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Stored Procedure**\nA Stored Procedure is a type of code in SQL that can be stored for later use and can be used many times. So, whenever you need to execute the query, instead of calling it you can just call the stored procedure. You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter values that is passed.\n1. **Advantages:**\n* Better Performance –\nThe procedure calls are quick and efficient as stored procedures are compiled once and stored in executable form. Hence the response is quick. The executable code is automatically cached, hence lowers the memory requirements.\n* Higher Productivity –\nSince the same piece of code is used again and again so, it results in higher productivity.\n* Ease of Use –\nTo create a stored procedure, one can use any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then, they can be deployed on any tier of network architecture.\n* Scalability –\nStored procedures increase scalability by isolating application processing on the server.\n* Maintainability –\nMaintaining a procedure on a server is much easier then maintaining copies on various client machines, this is because scripts are in one location.\n* Security –\nAccess to the Oracle data can be restricted by allowing users to manipulate the data only through stored procedures that execute with their definer’s privileges.\n\n2. **Disadvantages:**\n* Testing –\nTesting of a logic which is encapsulated inside a stored procedure is very difficult. Any data errors in handling stored procedures are not generated until runtime.\n* Debugging –\nDepending on the database technology, debugging stored procedures will either be very difficult or not possible at all. Some relational databases such as SQL Server have some debugging capabilities.\n* Versioning –\nVersion control is not supported by the stored procedure.\n* Cost –\nAn extra developer in the form of DBA is required to access the SQL and write a better stored procedure. This will automatically incur added cost.\n* Portability –\nComplex stored procedures will not always port to upgraded versions of the same database.
